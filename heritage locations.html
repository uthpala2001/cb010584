                        <p>. Dambulla cave temple, also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla, is a World Heritage Site in Sri Lanka's central region. This location is 148 km east of Colombo, 72 km north of Kandy, and 43 km north of Matale.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p1>. Dambulla is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers over the surrounding plains by 160 meters. There are over 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. The main attractions are spread out over five caves with statues and paintings. The life of Gautama Buddha inspired these paintings and statues. In total, there are 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings, and four statues of gods and goddesses. Among the latter are Vishnu and Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square meters. The cave walls depict the demon Mara's temptation and Buddha's first sermon.</p1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p2>. Because there are human skeleton burial sites in this area, near the Dambulla cave complexes, prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before Buddhism arrived in Sri Lanka.</p2>

                        <p>. In the first century BCE, this temple complex was built. It has five caves carved into a massive overhanging rock that are kept dry by a drip line. In 1938, arched colonnades and gabled entrances were added to the architecture. The cave ceilings are intricately painted with religious images that follow the contours of the rock. Images of the Lord Buddha, bodhisattvas, and other gods and goddesses can be found.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p1>. The Dambulla cave monastery is still in use and is Sri Lanka's best-preserved ancient structure. In the third and second centuries BC, this complex was established as one of the largest and most important monasteries. Valagamba of Anuradhapura is thought to have converted the caves into a temple in the first century BC. Exiled from Anuradhapura, he sought refuge here from South Indian usurpers for 15 years. The King built a temple to express his gratitude after reclaiming his capital. Many other kings added to it later, and by the 11th century, the caves had become a major religious center, which they remain today. Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa gilded the caves and added about 70 Buddha statues in 1190. The caves have been restored.</p1>

                            <p>. The temple consists of five caves varying in size and splendor. The caves, which were built at the base of a 150-meter-high rock during the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa periods, are by far the most impressive of Sri Lanka's cave temples. The gentle slope of Dambulla Rock provides a panoramic view of the surrounding flat lands, including the 19-kilometer-away rock fortress Sigiriya. At dusk, hundreds of swooping swallows flock to the cave entrance. This magnificent cave is 7m tall at its highest point, 52m long from east to west, and 23m long from the entrance to the back. Hindu deities, as well as the kings Valagamba and Nissankamalla, and Ananda, the Buddha's most devoted disciple, are among those depicted..</p>

                                    <p>.The first cave is known as Devaraja lena, which translates as "Cave of the Divine King." A 1st-century Brahmi inscription above the entrance to the first cave recounts the monastery's founding.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p1>. This cave is dominated by a 14-meter-high Buddha statue hewn from the rock. It has been repainted several times over its history, with the most recent coat most likely applied in the twentieth century. Ananda, Buddha's favorite disciple, is at his feet, and Vishnu, who is said to have created the caves with his divine powers, is at his head.</p1>

                                    <p> . In the second and largest cave, there are statues of the gods Saman and Vishnu, which pilgrims frequently decorate with garlands, as well as statues of King Vattagamani Abhaya, who honored the monastery in the first century BC, and King Nissanka Malla, who was responsible for the gilding of 50 statues in the 12th century, as indicated by a stone inscription near the monastery entrance. As a result, this cave is known as Maharaja lena, or "Cave of the Great Kings." On the left side of the room, a rock-carved Buddha statue is accompanied by wooden figures of the Bodhisattvas Maitreya and Avalokiteshvara or Natha. A dagoba and a spring that drips water are also present.</p>
